# Tic Tac Toe game
## Thu Oct 9th
### Creation of the Tic Tac Toe Game 

### What we need to have on the code:
- We need to define the background of the game with the spots to put the circle and the x 
- We need to define what it is the circle and the x. How they are two different players and two different imputs. 
- We need to define how to put the circle or the x on the screen. Like how big is going to appear on the screen. 
- We need to keep track of which player is playing. If its circle or x
- We need to keep track of where is it being played 
- Create a loop to continue the game going 
- The game will end and it will display a message if the player wants to continue playing or not.
