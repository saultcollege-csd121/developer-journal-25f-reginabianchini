# Intructions (Title)
## Tue Sep 16 (Date)
### The journal structure will look similar to this one (summarized sentance for the day)
(The rest of the lines will be the main topic learned that day or per Lab done)

## Reflection: 
The last part of the journal will be reflection about what was learned in a more summarized way and also things that I need to study more about it
