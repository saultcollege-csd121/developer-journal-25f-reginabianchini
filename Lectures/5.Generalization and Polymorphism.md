# Generalization and Polymorphism
## Tue Nov 11
### We just started to talk about generalization and polymorphism. 

- Inheritance and Interfaces:

- Software design principles:

    - Don't repeat yourself (DRY)

    - Software components should be:
        - Cohesive : degree to which the parts of one component are related to each other - weak cohension = harder to understand -> strong cohesion = easier to understand 
            - single responsability principle leads to stronger cohesion

           
        - loosely coupled with other components: degree which different components depend on each other - tight coupling = more interdependent, harder to maintain -> loose coupling = less interdependent, easier to maintain
             - Abstraction you only need to think about the abstraction and not the detailed implementation, it also helps you achieve a looser coupling
            - Encapsulation is one way to achieve cohesion, and a form of abtraction so it helps to create looser coupling

        - have a single responsability

    - Place repeated implementations of the same task into reusable functions

- Polymorphism: 
    - enabling of uniform interaction for different types
    - We already talked about: 
        - type coersion: automatic conversion between types
        - Method overloading: same method can handle different types
        - Operator overloading: + works on strings and ints
        - Generic types: a type that can hold any other type 

- Subtype polimorphism: 
    - Occurs when subtype vales are allowed to be treated as values of a subtype

- Generalization: 
    - share common details in a broader abstraction
    - can be useful to analyze the things being modelled in a program for common state or behaviour 
    - It reduces code repetition(DRY)
    - can make programs more maintainable

- Inheritance hierarchies: 
    - Both student and instructor objects will have the public interface of the person class in addition to the public interface of the student/instructor class 

- Java Exception Hierarchy:
    - A NullPointerException will have the public interface of its own class Plus that of RuntimeException, and Throwable

- Inheritance:
    - This as if 'is a ' relationship 
    - Ex: A student is a person
          An Instructor is an employee
          A NullPointerException is a RuntimeException

- Abstraction v Encapsulation v Generalization
    - Abstraction: focusing essential detail, ignoring irrelevant complexity
    - Encapsulation: hiding implementations detail, public members usually constitute the abstraction
    - Generalization: sharing common details in a broader abstraction, an encapsulation of common implementation details in a shared superclass, superclasses are abstractions of all their subclasses
