# Black Jack Game Production
## Thu Oct 9
### We are trying to program a black jack game  

### What we need on our code for the game: 

- We need to create the cards for the computer with all the details about it.
- Function that will define the suit of the card and their simbol
- create a function that will generate random cards that will be given to the player
- We need to define the number or letters on the cards. 
- At the end each card should have a power and a number or letter. 
- We need to keep track of the cards that have being played because on a deck there are a certain amount of cards 
- We need to keeep track of the cards played for dealer and players
- We need to keep track of winnings and looses 
- we need to keep track of current phase of the game 
- We need to create a public list of cards with deck, playerhand, and dealer hand 
- we need a mutable variable. record can not be used because is not mutable. So we need to use class. 
- Create money that the player has. It should add or subtract too based on if the player won or lost and how much the player beat on each round. 
- create funtion that deals two cards from the deck to player and dealer 
- check if the player or dealer has the summe of 21 that is also called black jack 
- If the player has black jack the game should end and give it to the player or dealer that had this in the hand 
- Summ how much the player and the dealer has in their hand 
- If none has a black jack just check which one has the higger amount in their hand 
- Higher number = winner. However, we should be carefull. 
- If the number is bigger than 21 the player ir dealer lose instantly 
- create two types of aces. Aces can be 11 or 1. 
-  If yes continue with the amount of money that was before
- If no it will exit the loop
