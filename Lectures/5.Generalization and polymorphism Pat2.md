# Generalization and Polymorphism Part 2
## Thu Nov 13
### Continuation of the class about generalization and polymorphism

- Static types vs Run-time types:
    - Static type of a reference variable determines which methods may be called on that variable. Checked at compile-time.
    - Run-time type of the instantiated object determines which method actually gets called at run-time

    - Ex: Person p = new Instructor();
          Person is static type 
          Instructor is run-time type

- Subtype Polymorphism:
    - dynamic method dispatch allows for subtype polymorphism
    - Ex: Animal  ---
    |               |

   Cat              Dog
    ^                ^
    |                |
   Lion             Wolf           Chihuahua
